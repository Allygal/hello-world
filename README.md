# hello-world

Hey All!
Allison here, I'm working on my Master's in Education to design curriculum and virtual reality immersive platforms in research and development of programs to enhance student learning.

I really want to be a Designer specifically for designing virtual reality programs that focus on Education (Students' and Teachers'). I am just learning and would love any tips on where to start and what best to focus on to teach myself the software, hardware components needed, programming language to best be familiar, etc. Anything to help me educate myself!!

California State University Channel Islands DOES NOT have any Virtual Reality anything in use outside of 2 Oculus Rift's in the Nursing Department and the Department of Nursing DOES NOT SHARE with the DOE.

Great to meet you!
